0x0002: This is the meeting room.
0x0003: Paloom lies east.You can't
        get there without a \x18[0x02].
0x0004: Off to \x18[0x2F]? Bad idea!
        The city's crawling with
        the Empire's monsters.
        
        You'd be lucky to make it
        to Gatrea up north!
        
0x0005: You're in the rebel
        hideout of Altair.
0x0006: Prince Gordon of Kashuan
        is hiding here in Altair.
        Something's made him

0x0007: \x18[0xED] \x18[0xEF] escaped to
        this town when \x18[0x2F] was
        sacked.
        
        She is leading the rebels
        while the King recovers.
        
        
0x0008: This is the town of
        Altair.The imperial forces
        haven't been deployed this
        far.
0x0009: Tobul,the man in the
        weapon shop,is a skilled
        blacksmith.
        
        Something's been bothering

0x000A: You can trust Paul.He only
        steals from the Empire.
0x000B: \x18[0x2F]'s been taken over by
        the Empire…
0x000C: Gatrea and Altair haven't
        fallen to the Empire…yet.
        
0x000D: There's a pub on the
        outskirts of Fynn.When
        the Empire invaded,the
        owner didn't make it out
        in time.Now he's serving
        drinks to the imperials.
        
0x000E: This is the village of
        Gatrea.\x18[0x2F] is across
        the lake,see?
0x000F: The King is most pleased
        with your work!
0x0010: The weapons we have
        are no match for the
        Empire's…
        If only we had \x18[0xF2]…
0x0011: Please bring \x18[0xF2]
        back to Altair!
0x0012: Off to Salamand? Go east
        to Paloom,and take a ship
        from there.You'd never
        make it there on foot!
0x0013: The Empire has enslaved
        the town of Bafsk,and is
        forcing them to build the
        \x18[0xF3].
0x0014: Use that \x18[0x02] to cross
        the lake to the east to
        reach Paloom.
0x0015: If you can find some
        \x18[0xF2] to give to Tobul,
        he'll be able to make
        some superb weapons.
0x0016: Will the war ever end?
0x0017: \x18[0xF2]? What's that?
        Does it taste good?
0x0018: In Paloom,take a ship
        to Poft.From there,head
        north to reach Salamand.
0x0019: You've seen the \x18[0xF5]
        flying about? A man named
        Cid pilots it.
0x001A: It's the warriors who've
        caught the eye of \x18[0xED]
        \x18[0xEF]!
0x001B: Overthrow the Emperor and
        restore peace to the
        world!
0x001C: Is that Scott's \x18[0x01]?
        There's this spell that he
        would say to the \x18[0x01] and
        it would show a map.
        It went like:
        Tceles Nottub B
        
        
0x001D: The ship headin' out of
        here will take ye to
        Poft.
0x001E: This is the port town of
        Paloom.
0x001F: The cities past Poft are
        occupied by the Empire.

        freedom.Wanna settle
        down here with me,cutie?
0x0022: Pirate:Now there's a
        fine lass.Lemme buy you
        a drink!
        
        \x11\x02:With you? No way!
        
0x0023: This is the port of Poft.
        Salamand is to the north,
        and to our east is Bafsk.
0x0024: Have you seen the
        \x18[0xF5]?
        
        
        It was built by Cid,who
        lives here in Poft.
        Only he can fly it.
        
0x0025: You lookin' for Cid? He's
        probably over in the pub.
        A few gil will get you a
        ride on his \x18[0xF5].
0x0026: Bafsk,the city to our
        east,is occupied by the
        Empire.They're building
        something terrible there…
0x0027: His Majesty is greatly
        reassured by your
        wonderful work.
0x0028: Please destroy the
        \x18[0xF3]!
0x0029: If the Empire completes
        the \x18[0xF3],then
        Altair,Poft…all will be
        lost.
0x002A: I can see…A great evil in
        the skies,like roiling
        storm clouds.
0x002B: Bafsk is controlled by
        the \x18[0xEE].
        
        
        He used hypnosis to
        manipulate the minds of
        the townspeople.
        
0x002C: Blow that \x18[0xF3]
        to bits!
0x002D: They say Borghen's
        replaced the \x18[0xEE]
        as commander in Bafsk.
0x002E: I'm gonna join the rebel
        army and fight!
0x002F: You must destroy the
        \x18[0xF3] before it's
        completed.
0x0030: I heard of the rebel army,
        so I joined!
0x0031: They're building the
        \x18[0xF3] in Bafsk.
0x0032: Is Altair gonna be taken
        over by the Empire?
0x0033: Tobul's making lots of
        weapons with that \x18[0xF2]
        you found.
0x0034: The King's condition has
        worsened…
0x0035: Blew up the \x18[0xF3],
        did you? I knew you had
        it in you!
0x0036: The Princess is safe,
        but the King is not well…
0x0037: You did it!You destroyed
        the \x18[0xF3]!
0x0038: What a relief!
0x0039: The \x18[0xF3] was
        destroyed? Nice!
0x003A: We've lost our King…
0x003B: Deist? It's an island
        kingdom located east of
        the snow plains.
        
        Take a ship from Paloom
        and sail south.
        
0x003C: His Majesty's…passed way…
0x003D: I wanna ride a \x18[0xFB] and
        soar the skies!
0x003E: Deist is home to \x18[0xFB]s
        and \x18[0xFA]s.Get there by
        taking a ship out of
        Paloom.
0x003F: Deist? Ask someone else.
0x0040: Going to Deist? Head back
        to Paloom and take a ship
        there.
0x0041: Josef's dead,isn't he…
0x0042: The King is not well.
0x0043: Do we stand a chance
        against the \x18[0xF3]?
0x0044: They finally finished the
        \x18[0xF3]…
0x0045: I called it!Obviously
        the task was more than
        you could handle!
0x0046: The \x18[0xF3] attacked
        Altair.Fortunately,the
        hideout is unscathed.
        
        The townspeople have taken
        refuge here.
        
0x0047: If we don't destroy the
        \x18[0xF3],more people
        will die.
0x0048: Cid might know if the
        \x18[0xF3] has any
        weaknesses.
        
        He's the first person to
        ever build an \x18[0xF5].
        
0x0049: I'm scared…
0x004A: Please,Lord,save our King.
0x004B: We'll stay here and hold
        out until you return.
0x004C: Where is Prince \x18[0xEB]?
0x004D: The \x18[0xF3] attacked…
        At least our hideout is
        safe.
0x004E: Everyone who was outside
        is dead…
0x004F: The \x18[0xF3] killed
        them all…
0x0050: I'm hurt…I don't think I'm
        gonna make it…
0x0051: The \x18[0xF3] attacked…
0x0052: They killed my daughter…
0x0053: The \x18[0xF3] opened
        fire and killed everyone…
0x0054: You must rescue the
        \x18[0xED]!
0x0055: \x18[0xED] \x18[0xEF] was
        captured by the
        \x18[0xF3]!
0x0056: The \x18[0xF3] is heading
        north of \x18[0x2F].
0x0057: This is all your fault!
0x0058: The \x18[0xED] is trapped on
        the \x18[0xF3]!
0x0059: I tried to stop the
        \x18[0xED] from boarding the
        \x18[0xF5]…
0x005A: If the \x18[0xF3] attacks
        again,we're finished!
0x005B: \x18[0xED] \x18[0xEF]…
0x005C: The Empire has a supply
        base to the north of \x18[0x2F].
        The \x18[0xF3] may have
        docked there.
0x005D: The \x18[0xED] left on Cid's
        Airship to meet you at
        Kashuan.
0x005E: That's…the \x18[0xF7]!
0x005F: Use the \x18[0xF7] to blow up
        the \x18[0xF3]!

0x0062: \x18[0xED] \x18[0xEF] was
        captured…
0x0063: I hear the Empire captured
        the \x18[0xED] and Cid's
        \x18[0xF5].
0x0064: Maybe I oughta join the
        imperial army.

        and tell the rebels!
0x0066: Prince \x18[0xEB] has led the
        army strongly since the
        King's passing.
0x0067: The \x18[0xFA]s…vanquished?
0x0068: Why is the \x18[0xED] acting
        so weird?
0x0069: Good to see you back
        safely.
0x006A: The \x18[0xED] has been
        acting very strange.
0x006B: Prince \x18[0xEB] has become a
        firm leader thanks to his
        time spent with your lot.
0x006C: Why does the \x18[0xED] just
        laugh when I talk to her?
0x006D: The \x18[0xED] is acting
        weird.
0x006E: I've lost sleep over
        fearing the Empire…
0x006F: Welcome to the rebel army,
        Leila.
0x0070: The \x18[0xED] won't come out

        cave there.
0x0076: The \x18[0xED] of \x18[0x2F]'s been
        acting odd lately.

0x0078: The \x18[0xED]…an impostor?
0x0079: The \x18[0xF0] will attend
        the tournament.This could
        be our chance to defeat
        him.

0x0081: Take care,Prince \x18[0xEB].
0x0082: Minwu still hasn't returned
        from \x18[0xF8].
0x0083: Even the \x18[0xFA]s lost to
        the Empire…
0x0084: I hope the \x18[0xED] is

0x0091: We got \x18[0x2F] back?
0x0092: Ye folks are heroes!
0x0093: They say the books in
        \x18[0xF8] hold all the
        secrets of the world…
0x0094: The Empire has enslaved
        the men of Salamand and
        forced them to work in
        the cave at Semitt Falls.
        Please,help them all!
        
        
0x0095: Semitt Falls is beyond
        the mountains to the
        south of Salamand.
        
        That's where the Empire

0x0098: Thank you so much for
        saving us.
0x0099: You'll need a Snowcraft
        to get across snowfields.
        
        
        I've heard that Josef
        hides his Snowcraft in
        the cavern at Semitt
        Falls.
        I remember him saying
        something about a wall
        near a blue stone…
        
0x009A: …
0x009B: That Borghen is a
        buffoon!
0x009C: Is the \x18[0xEE] ever
        going to return?
0x009D: Get back to work!
        No one wants to work
        under General Borghen…
0x009E: General Borghen needs to
        be more firm with these
        peasants.
0x009F: You're with the rebels?
        You've got to destroy the
        \x18[0xF3]!
0x00A0: They're making us work
        like slaves.I can't
        remember what it was like
        when the \x18[0xEE] was
        in command.
        
0x00A1: There's a rebel spy
        masquerading as an
        imperial soldier.
        Go talk to him.
0x00A2: You'll need a \x18[0x03] to
        board the \x18[0xF3].
0x00A3: They've finished the
        \x18[0xF3].We're doomed…
0x00A4: The \x18[0xF3] headed
        for Poft.
0x00A5: You must tell \x18[0xED]
        \x18[0xEF] about the
        \x18[0xF3]!
0x00A6: We're doomed!
0x00A7: Thanks for blowing up
        the \x18[0xF3]!
0x00A8: Without the \x18[0xF3],
        the Empire's not so scary!
0x00A9: You did it!
0x00AA: Great job!
0x00AB: We're taking back our
        castle!
0x00AC: We've infiltrated the
        castle!The enemy is in

        \x18[0x2F]!
0x00AE: Have you been to Paul's
        house yet? He was excited
        to be back home.
0x00AF: Thank you!
0x00B0: We've taken \x18[0x2F] back,but
        the war isn't over yet.
        We need Minwu to return
        from \x18[0xF8]…
0x00B1: Living here again is like
        a dream come true.
0x00B2: I never thought I'd be
        able to come back to \x18[0x2F]
        during my lifetime.
0x00B3: You beat the big bad?
        Wow…
0x00B4: The \x18[0xF1] flies high
        over \x18[0x2F] once more!
0x00B5: \x18[0x2F] is ours again at
        last!
0x00B6: We owe it all to you.
        Thank you.
0x00B7: \x18[0xED] \x18[0xEF] and Prince
        \x18[0xEB] await you in the
        audience chamber.
0x00B8: I hope Minwu is alright…
0x00B9: There are many ancient
        books in \x18[0xF8].
0x00BA: A secret connected to the
        Mysidian Tower lies
        beneath this castle.
0x00BB: These steps lead to the
        Mirror Chamber.
0x00BC: Please prepare your

        destroyed many towns…
0x00C4: \x18[0x2F] is doomed if the

0x00C5: It's impossible to enter
        the \x18[0xFC]!It would tear

        by mountains.
0x00CF: The imperial forces

0x00D0: Only you can do this!

        that protects the tower.
