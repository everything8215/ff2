dialogue (npc $00-$5F)
0x0000: The door is locked.
0x0001: \x18[0xEF]:The password is
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF1]).
0x0002: \x18[0xEF]:The \x18[0xF1] is
        the insignia of the
        Kingdom of \x18[0x2F].
        
        \x11\x02,your brother
        \x07 is missing? I think
        he's being held in \x18[0x2F].
        
        But \x18[0x2F] is now prowling
        with the Emperor's beasts…
        Entering \x18[0x2F] won't be
        easy.
0x0003: \x18[0xEF]:That \x18[0x01]…It's
        Scott's!Is he…alive?
        
        
        \x10\x02:He gave us this
        \x18[0x01] in \x18[0x2F]…just before
        he lost the last of his
        strength.
        \x18[0xEF]:Did he…say
        anything?
        
        
        \x10\x02:No…Nothing.Your
        Highness,please keep
        this \x18[0x01].
        
        \x18[0xEF]:No,you keep it.
        You infiltrated \x18[0x2F] and
        returned safely.I
        underestimated you.
        Perhaps you can help us?
        
        
        
        Help us find the rare
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF2]) for our army's
        equipment.
        
0x0004: We lost \x18[0x2F] because the
        Empire had weapons made
        of \x18[0xF2].
        
        A rebel in Salamand named
        Josef is looking for
        \x18[0xF2],but he hasn't
        reported back.
        Will you go with Minwu to
        Salamand to look into
        this?
        
0x0005: Minwu is a virtuous white
        wizard.He will help you.
0x0006: The Empire also suffered
        heavy losses during the
        battle for \x18[0x2F].
        
        In Bafsk,they're
        building the (\x16\x0E\x18[0xF3])
        to compensate for those
        losses.
0x0007: The Empire is using the
        people of Bafsk to build
        the \x18[0xF3].
        
        The \x18[0xF3] is a
        massive,heavily armed
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF5]).
        
0x0008: A man named Cid,former
        leader of \x18[0x2F]'s White
        Knights,built an
        \x18[0xF5].He became
        obsessed with this \x18[0xF5]
        and flew away from \x18[0x2F].
        
        
        He now lives in Poft,
        granting travelers the
        passage on his \x18[0xF5]
        for a fee.
        He uses this money to
        make further refinements
        to his \x18[0xF5].
        
0x0009: You've found the \x18[0xF2]!
        Please hand it over to
        Tobul in the weapon shop.
        
        Now we'll be able to
        fight the Empire with
        equal strength!
        
0x000A: The \x18[0xF3]'s
        construction is overseen
        by the \x18[0xEE],
        a competent adversary.
        Fortunately,he was
        called back to Palamecia.
        
        
        The theft of the \x18[0xF2]
        has likely knocked the
        Empire off balance.
        
        The (\x16\x05\x18[0xF3]) must be
        destroyed…
        
0x000B: We have a man in Bafsk.
        He's found a way to reach
        the Dreadnought.It must
        be destroyed.
        I have full confidence
        that with you and \x13\x02
        on this task,it will be
        accomplished.
0x000C: \x18[0xEF]:Many were hurt by
        the \x18[0xF3]'s attack.
        
        
        My father's condition is
        worsening from all of
        the stress…
        
        \x11\x02:Is there nothing
        you can do,\x13\x02?
        
        
        \x13\x02:It is my duty to
        ease the pain of the
        wounded.
        
        I shall remain here
        to watch over the King.
        I take my leave of you.
        
        \x10\x02,waste no time in
        destroying the
        \x18[0xF3].
        
        
         \x13\x02 leaves the party.
        
0x000D: My father's condition is
        improving thanks to
        Minwu.
0x000E: Many lives were taken in
        the \x18[0xF3]'s attack.
        That thing is so horrible…
0x000F: I've heard Scott and
        \x18[0xEB] mention the Bell.
        
        
        The gates of Kashuan Keep
        open only to the voice of
        a Kashuan or the sound of
        that Bell.
        The Bell rests deep
        within a cavern on the
        snow plains.You plan on
        going there?
        If only \x18[0xEB] were here,
        there would be no need
        for you to risk such
        danger…
        Josef knows the snow
        plains like the back of
        his hand.You should seek
        his counsel.
0x0010: \x18[0xEF]:\x18[0xF7] is the
        crest of the Kingdom of
        Kashuan.
        
        Its flame still burns on
        the ground floor of
        Kashuan Keep.
        
        Scott and \x18[0xEB] have told
        me that the flame cannot
        be passed to just any
        torch.
        \x10\x02:Perhaps we can
        use \x18[0xF7] to destroy
        the \x18[0xF3]?
        
        \x18[0xEF]:Ah!Then you must
        depart for Kashuan Keep
        at once!Cid's \x18[0xF5]
        can take you there.
        But…what can you use to
        bring the \x18[0xF7] back?
        
0x0011: \x13\x02!Good to see you.
        Please aid \x10\x02.
0x0012: Please find that \x18[0xF2]
        as soon as possible.
0x0013: \x18[0xEF]:We traded that Bell
        with Josef's life…
        
        
        We can't let his death be
        in vain.You must take the
        Bell to Kashuan Keep
        at once.
0x0014: \x18[0xEF]:\x18[0xEB]!You should've
        helped us!Josef died
        because of you!
        
        \x18[0xEB]:\x18[0xEF],I…
        
        
        
        \x18[0xEF]:Don't speak to me!
        
0x0015: \x18[0xEF]:Let's get out of
        here quick!
0x0016: Hahaha…
0x0017: \x18[0xEF]:I need to talk to
        \x10\x02…
0x0018: \x18[0xEF]:\x10\x02!\x11\x02!
        \x12\x02!I owe you my life.
        You even destroyed the
        \x18[0xF3]!
0x0019: Do not fear.I am the true
        \x18[0xED].
0x001A: \x13\x02!\x18[0xEB]'s come up
        with a plan to get our
        Castle back!
0x001B: \x18[0xEF]:It's so good to be
        back.
        
        
        This wouldn't have been
        possible had we not worked
        together.Thanks so much.
        However,Minwu left for
        \x18[0xF8] and we haven't
        heard back.Will you please
        go to (\x16\x07\x18[0xF8]) to look
        into the matter?
0x001C: \x18[0xF8] is a land of
        mages.Without their help,
        defeating the \x18[0xF0] won't
        be easy.I've heard that the
        ultimate magic lies in the
        \x18[0xF8]n Tower.Obtaining
        it requires two (\x16\x11\x18[0xFE])s.
        
0x001D: According to legend,a
        passage to Hell opened
        long ago.Monsters poured
        through the passage and
        entered our world.Ultima
        was the magic that drove
        them back.
        
0x001E: The valiant \x18[0xFA]s of
        Deist are no more…
        At least we have you guys.
0x001F: The Mirror Chamber in this
        castle has the power to
        call \x18[0xFB]s.But the
        \x18[0xFB] has yet to hatch…
0x0020: The White Mask rests
        beneath Castle \x18[0x2F].
        
        
        I'll tell you the
        incantation to open the
        door,so listen carefully:
        veve…(\x16\x06\x18[0xFF])…
0x0021: I don't know the door's
        location…
0x0022: \x18[0xEF]:Take the White \x18[0xFE]
        to \x18[0xF8].The mages there
        could help.
0x0023: \x18[0xEF]:A Crystal Rod!
        You can now enter the
        \x18[0xF8]n Tower!
0x0024: \x18[0xEF]:You were swallowed
        by Leviathan? Thank God
        you're safe.I hope Minwu
        is safe too…
0x0025: \x18[0xEF]:Are you…a \x18[0xFA]?
        
        
        
        \x13\x02:\x13\x02 Highwind,
        \x18[0xFA] of Deist.An honor
        to meet you.
        
        When Deist was attacked,
        I left to find \bookUltima.
        
        
        I met \x10\x02 and his
        friends during that
        journey.
        
0x0026: Have you tried summoning
        the \x18[0xFB] from the Mirror
        Chamber?
        
        No,of course not.It's still
        just an egg.
        
0x0027: \x18[0xEF]:The \x18[0xF0] created
        a Cyclone and has already
        destroyed Altair,Gatrea,
        Paloom and Poft…
        The (\x16\x05\x18[0xFC]) is now
        headed towards \x18[0x2F]…
        
0x0028: Reflecting light from the
        \x18[0x09] into the castle's
        Mirror can summon \x18[0xFB]s.
0x0029: The \x18[0xF0] is controlling
        the \x18[0xFC].
0x002A: \x18[0xEF]:A \x18[0xFB]!It's quite
        young,but it'll do!
0x002B: You could fly into the
        \x18[0xFC] on the \x18[0xFB].
0x002C: I hope those small wings
        can withstand the \x18[0xFC].
0x002D: \x18[0xEF]:\x07?
        The \x18[0xEE]? But he
        was your friend…
        
        \x11\x02:I'll go to him.
        He's my brother…He must be
        under the \x18[0xF0]'s spell!
        
        \x18[0xEF]:But since he took
        the throne…then he must be
        in (\x16\x04\x18[0xF4])!
        
0x002E: \x18[0xEF]:Castle \x18[0xF4]
        is in the mountains.It
        can't be reached by foot.
0x002F: \x18[0xEF]:Once,the monsters
        of Hell poured forth into
        the world.
        
        They entered through the
        (\x16
        \x18[0xFD]).
        
0x0030: It is near \x18[0xF8].
0x0031: Minwu:Proceed to \x18[0x2F].
        It will be your first step
        towards fulfilling your
        fate.
0x0032: Ah!You know the password.
        Heed well the information
        it will bring you.
0x0033: Minwu:Take my canoe and
        let us be on our way.
0x0034: Minwu:The King's illness
        is severe.There is little
        I can do.
0x0035: The \x18[0xF3] is a
        massive \x18[0xF5].It is
        likely they function
        similarly.
0x0036: Cid gave up all he had
        for his \x18[0xF5].His
        rank,his honor,his
        family…everything.
0x0037: \x18[0xEB] would know where
        the Bell is kept…but I
        haven't seen him lately.
        
        Someone close to Scott or
        \x18[0xEB] may know where to
        find it.
        
0x0038: Every three years they
        celebrate a Festival of
        the Flame in Kashuan.
        
        The \x18[0xF7] is passed to
        Egil's Torch while its
        brazier is cleansed.
        
0x0039: Minwu:The \x18[0xED] wanted
        to meet up with you at
        Kashuan to thank you
        for your help.
0x003A: The \x18[0xF3] will have
        to land at some point to
        replenish its supplies.
0x003B: Minwu:You've come at last!
        The seal on this door is
        extremely strong.I'll give
        it all I've got.Stand back!
0x003C: I'm \x18[0xEB].I was once a
        prince of Kashuan…Now
        I'm nothing but a coward.
        
        I abandoned my kingdom and
        my brother,Scott,and
        fled here…
        
0x003D: You're going to join the
        rebellion? I'm so afraid
        \x18[0xEF] will turn me away
        that I haven't even
        asked.Instead,I sulk
        around here…
        
0x003E: In Kashuan,Scott had
        inherited a \x18[0xF2] sword
        that had been handed down
        through the ages.
        It was truly a
        magnificent blade.
        
        
0x003F: I've heard the rumors…
        
        
        
        If the \x18[0xF3] is
        completed,it will destroy
        everything.But what can I
        do to stop it?
        I couldn't even save my
        own brother…
        
0x0040: So you found \x18[0xF2]!
        You're certainly brave,
        and you have a girl with
        you…
        Now I realize just how
        pathetic I am…
        
0x0041: You're off to destroy the
        \x18[0xF3]!? There has
        to be something I can do.
        
        If I were only half as
        strong as you…
        
0x0042: \x18[0xEB]:I came to retrieve
        the \x18[0xF7].I thought I
        was the only one left who
        could open the door.
        I'm looking for
        Egil's Torch,but it's a
        monster's den in here.
        
        I can't return empty-
        handed…But I don't know
        what to do next…
        
        \x11\x02:But you know your
        way around the keep,right?
        
        
        \x18[0xEB]:The keep is riddled
        with secrets even I don't
        understand.
        
        I can't guide you,but can
        I come with you?
        
        
        
         \x18[0xEB] joins the party!
        
0x0043: Gordon:When the \x18[0xF0]
        raided Deist,it was just a
        small incident.
        
        But the \x18[0xF0],fearful of
        the (\x16\x05\x18[0xFA])s,meant to
        exterminate them.
        
0x0044: Some say the \x18[0xFA]s can
        speak the language of the
        (\x16
        \x18[0xFB])s.
0x0045: You might find a \x18[0xFB] at
        Deist.It would be a great
        ally.Take a ship from
        Paloom to Deist.
0x0046: \x18[0xEB]:So the \x18[0xFA]s are
        gone…What are you doing
        here? Get that egg to the
        Life Spring!
0x0047: \x18[0xEB]:\x18[0xEF]'s been acting
        strange.I don't know what I
        can do to help her…Will
        you speak to her for me?
0x0048: I hope the egg hatches
        soon.
0x0049: While we hold the imperial
        forces at bay,you'll slip
        in and kill the castellan.
0x004A: \x18[0xEB]:Thanks to you all,
        we have regained Castle
        \x18[0x2F].But Minwu has not
        returned.
        Please go and search for
        him in (\x16\x08\x18[0xF8]).
        
0x004B: The \x18[0xF8]n Tower is said
        to hold the (\x16\x0D\x18[0xF9]),
        a text containing the
        ultimate magic.
0x004C: I'm certain it would help
        us defeat the \x18[0xF0].
0x004D: \x18[0xEF] knows this castle
        best.But,Paul,the greatest
        thief in the world,might
        know some secrets too!
0x004E: \x18[0xEB]:The \x18[0xF0] has
        been laying low,but I'm
        sure he's planning
        something.
        Find the \x18[0xF9] as
        soon as possible.
        
0x004F: \x18[0xEB]:A \x18[0xFA]!Let us
        rid the world of the
        \x18[0xF0]!
0x0050: \x18[0xEB]:\bookUltima is in our
        hands,but what good does
        it do for us?
        
        The (\x16\x05\x18[0xFC]) will defeat
        us regardless…
        
0x0051: We would need to fly to
        get in there…
0x0052: The center of the \x18[0xFC]
        is clear of wind.
0x0053: \x18[0xEB]:You're not going to
        fight \x11\x02's brother,are
        you?
        
        \x10\x02:We're the only ones
        who can get to him…
        
        
        \x18[0xEB]:Well…be careful.
        
0x0054: It's an impregnable
        fortress.Paul might have
        snuck in before.
0x0055: \x18[0xEB]:The castle that
        appeared when the \x18[0xF0]
        was resurrected…I've no
        doubt it was Pandaemonium,
        the fortress of the lord
        of Hell.
        
0x0056: Kashuan myths say that the
        portal to Hell is near
        \x18[0xF8].
0x0057: I'm Paul,the legendary
        thief!The imperial
        coffers have kept my purse
        bulging with gil!
0x0058: I never steal from the
        rebels.I'm from \x18[0x2F],
        too,but I had to flee
        from the Empire…
0x0059: Paul:\x10\x02!Thank
        goodness you're here!
        
        
        This is Josef's daughter,
        Nelly.That bastard
        Borghen held her hostage
        to threaten Josef.
        I came here to look for
        \x18[0xF2],but ended up
        getting caught!
        
        So long!I'll help
        everyone here escape.
        Thanks for saving us!
        
0x005A: Paul:\x10\x02!
        How've you been?
0x005B: Secret door in Castle
        \x18[0x2F]? 'Course I know!What's
        inside? A White \x18[0xFE]?
        Sounds like nothing
        special.To find the secret
        door,look in the upper
        right corner of the
        audience chamber.What do
        you need a mask like that
        for?
        
0x005C: Paul:How do you fight a
        \x18[0xFC]?
0x005D: You're gonna go INTO that
        thing!? You're mad!
        Well I've got some things
        that might help.
        Check the wall by the bed.
        
0x005E: Paul:Now we have to deal
        with the \x18[0xEE]…
0x005F: Paul:That was Cid's will,
        y'know…
        
        
        He knew he didn't have
        much time left.He wanted
        you to have his \x18[0xF5].
        
        He loved his \x18[0xF5] with
        all his heart…and he
        entrusted it to you.
        
0x0060: I've been there.I used a
        kite to land on the roof.
        You can get there…from the
        sky!Like with an \x18[0xF5]!
0x0061: Paul:\x10\x02…Promise me
        that you'll come back
        safe.
0x0062: Josef:You have business
        with me?
0x0063: A little short in the
        tooth,aren't you?
        You kids can't fool me.
0x0064: \x18[0xF2]? I haven't found
        any.I do have a few
        leads,but…
        
        I'm gonna need you to
        prove you are who you say
        you are before I tell ya.
        
        There's a bunch of people
        from Salamand who are
        being forced to work in
        the cave at Semitt Falls.
        Rescue them,and we'll
        talk.
        
        
0x0065: Of course I've heard of
        that ugly \x18[0xF5]!
0x0066: I know an \x18[0xF5] expert.
        But why should I tell you
        who he is?
0x0067: Josef:You saved my
        daughter.Thank you.
        
        
        That cowardly Borghen had
        been threatening Nelly to
        get to me…
        
        If there's anything I can
        do to help,just ask.
        
0x0068: The cave behind Semitt
        Falls used to be an old
        \x18[0xF2] mine.
        
        The deepest parts of the
        cave still have \x18[0xF2]
        deposits.
        
0x0069: Since the \x18[0xEE]
        took over,construction
        has sped up.I hear it's
        close to completion.
0x006A: Cid is the leading expert
        on \x18[0xF5]s.
0x006B: You'd better get that
        \x18[0xF2] back to Altair.
0x006C: You need my Snowcraft to
        reach the snow cavern.
        It's hidden in the mine.
        
        Look for a blue stone on
        the first floor,and head
        right to the secret room.
        Let's go!
        
          Josef joins the party!
        
0x006D: Leila:Lookin' for ride to
        Deist,are ye? Well,this be
        yer lucky day!Me ship was
        about to leave for Deist.
        Be ye wantin' a ride?
        
        
        
        \x11\x02:Something's fishy…
        
        
        
        \x10\x02:It's fine!It's a free
        ride.We'll take up your
        offer!
        
        Leila:Alrighty.I'll be
        waitin' outside the city
        for ye!
        
0x006E: Leila:Ye don't need to
        be worryin' about us!
0x006F: Leila:Together!
        Let me join ye!
        
        
        
          Leila joins the party!
        
0x0070: Leila:I thought ye were
        dead for sure.Glad ye'all
        are safe!
0x0071: The \x18[0xED] ran off!
0x0072: Leila:The \x18[0xEE] went
        and claimed the throne
        fer himself.
0x0073: Paul's always braggin'
        bout how he snuck in
        there before…
0x0074: Leila:The \x18[0xF0] sold
        his soul to the devil.
0x0075: There's a narrow strait
        east of \x18[0xF8].That area
        is the Jade Sea.
0x0076: And who are you guys?
0x0077: I've been to \x18[0xF8].
0x0078: How'd you know about that?
0x0079: \x18[0xFB]s? Why ask?
        Who are you?
0x007A: Yes…I'm a \x18[0xFA].
        
        
        
        What? They've been
        destroyed? That's absurd!
        
0x007B: So you came for \bookUltima
        too? Let me join you.
        
        
        There's a boat up ahead,
        but a monster is blocking
        the way.
        
        
          Ricard the \x18[0xFA]
          joins the party!
        
0x007C: King:An arrow struck me.
        My daughter,\x18[0xEF],is
        in charge now.
0x007D: King:So we've lost
        Scott…He was going to
        propose to \x18[0xEF],you know.
        
        I always thought he'd
        make a fine husband for
        her…
        
0x007E: What? Borghen betrayed
        us? Curse him!
0x007F: Long ago,\x18[0xF2] was in
        common use.
        
        
        \x18[0xF2] was mined in the
        north near Semitt Falls.
        
0x0080: The Empire is building
        WHAT? No one told me of
        that!
        
        I see…They didn't tell me
        for fear of worrying me…
        
0x0081: King:So many perished
        in the (\x16\x08\x18[0xF3])'s
        attack…Perhaps we should
        surrender…
0x0082: Cid is the expert on
        \x18[0xF5]s.He was such a
        fine knight once…
0x0083: The whereabouts of the
        Bell are known only to
        the Kashuan royal family.
0x0084: Scott sealed the gates of
        Kashuan Keep to protect
        the \x18[0xF7] in case they
        were defeated in battle.
        You will need the
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF6]) to break
        the seal.
        
0x0085: King:Please…rescue my
        daughter…
0x0086: Cid:You here to ride the
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF5])? If you've got
        cash,there's no place I
        can't take ya.
0x0087: Hmph.That oversized
        garbage scow? \x18[0xF5]s
        aren't about how big ya
        build 'em.
0x0088: You want on the (\x16\x11\x18[0xF5]),
        you pay the guy behind
        me.
0x0089: You need to blow up the
        engine to destroy that
        ugly thing.
0x008A: \x18[0xF5]s are powered by
        (\x16
        \x18[0xF7]).
        The \x18[0xF3] is no
        different.
0x008B: Controlling \x18[0xF7] is
        tricky.Let the flames
        get too high,then it'll
        blow up.
0x008C: Cid:I'll head for the
        \x18[0xF5] with the \x18[0xED].
        You find that engine and
        toss the \x18[0xF7] in!
        The \x18[0xF3] will blow
        up,and I'll have my \x18[0xF5]
        ready for takeoff!
        
0x008D: Cid:That \x18[0xFC] hit me
        bad in Paloom…Urngh…
0x008E: 
0x008F: Nelly:Sob…
0x0090: Nelly:Thanks for saving
        me.
0x0091: Nelly:Come back soon,
        Daddy!
0x0092: Nelly:Daddy…
0x0093: Borghen:Work!
        The sooner we finish,
        the greater my glory!
0x0094: Borghen:Curses!The \x18[0xF0]
        will never forgive me!If I
        go back,he'll kill me!
        
        If I'm going to die,
        you're coming with me!
        
0x0095: \x18[0xFB]:Sss…Yraa…
0x0096: \x10\x02:Please,help us
        fight!
        
        
        \x18[0xFB]:The Empire has
        poisoned me.I won't
        live much longer.
        
0x0097: Shortly before the battle
        with the Empire,a \x18[0xFA]
        named Ricard set out to
        find the ultimate magic.
0x0098: Please hear my final wish.
        
        
        
        Take this egg to the cave
        north of here and place it
        in the Life Spring.This is
        the last \x18[0xFB] Egg.If it
        is not submerged in the
        Life Spring,it will wither
        and die.
        
        Received the Wyvern Egg!
        
0x0099: \x18[0xFB]:The egg…Take it to
        the Life Spring…I beg you…
0x009A: Customers aren't allowed
        behind the counter!
        
        
        Bleedin imperials are
        nothing but an ill-bred
        rabble…
        
0x009B: Aha!You're with the
        rebels!There's a secret
        door in this wall.A
        wounded soldier is inside.
0x009C: If you're…going to turn
        me over to the Empire…
        kill me first…
0x009D: So…you're rebels…right?
        I'm Prince Scott of
        Kashuan…
        
        \x10\x02:Prince Scott? We
        were told you didn't make
        it…
        
        Scott:I'm barely alive…
        I have…a favor to ask.Tell
        my brother,\x18[0xEB],that he's
        strong…and needs more
        faith…in himself…
        Also,the king must know
        that…the reason \x18[0x2F] lost
        is because…Count Borghen
        betrayed us.He's now…a
        general in…the imperial
        army…
        
        And tell \x18[0xEF] that I love
        her.No.No,don't deliver
        that last…message.The
        confessions of a dying
        man…They would only
        bring her pain.
        
        
        \x11\x02:My…my brother,
        \x07.Have you heard news
        of him?
        
        Scott:I'm sorry…but I
        have not.
        
        
        Here.I want you to…to
        take my \x18[0x01].I'm sure it
        will be of use.
        
        I've grown extremely
        tired.If you'll excuse
        me,I…just need to rest…
        for a little while…
        
          Received Scott's \x18[0x01]…
        
0x009E: Tobul:I'm just a batty
        old man…
0x009F: Or am I?
        I'm Tobul,the best
        blacksmith around!
0x00A0: If I had some \x18[0xF2],I
        could make finer
        equipment.
0x00A1: That's \x18[0xF2]!I'll start
        making new equipment!
0x00A2: No time to talk.
        There's work to be done!
0x00A3: Child:Go away!Don't come
        any closer!
0x00A4: Child:I'm gonna tell my
        mom!
0x00A5: As the clear tone of the
        Bell rings out,the lock
        opens without a sound.
0x00A6: Child:You're not the bad
        guys?
0x00A7: When I grow up,I wanna be
        a \x18[0xFA] just like my dad
        was!
0x00A8: The \x18[0xFB]'s in that room.
        Mommy says it's gonna die
        soon,is that true?
0x00A9: The \x18[0xFB] died…
0x00AA: Child:Are you a \x18[0xFA]?
        \x13\x02:Yes.I was a friend
        of your father's.I promise
        to avenge him.When the
        \x18[0xF0] is defeated,I'll
        come back and raise you
        to be a \x18[0xFA].
        
        Child:Okay!You get that
        \x18[0xF0]!
        
0x00AB: Why isn't that \x18[0xFA] man
        with you guys?
0x00AC: I hope my son hasn't
        bothered you.I apologize.
        
        
        My husband was a \x18[0xFA].
        He and the others were
        killed by the imperials.
        
        In the room behind us is
        the last \x18[0xFB].It's trying
        to tell us something,but I
        don't speak its tongue.
        Every \x18[0xFA] carries a
        \x18[0x09].I've heard one
        was lost in the cavern
        north of here.
        With that \x18[0x09],we
        could speak with the
        (\x16
        \x18[0xFB]).Can you find it?
        
0x00AD: The \x18[0xFA]s fought
        valiantly,but the Empire
        poisoned the \x18[0xFB]'s
        water.With their \x18[0xFB]s
        dead,the (\x16\x0A\x18[0xFA])s were
        wiped out by the Empire…
        
0x00AE: Deep within the cavern is
        the Life Spring,the place
        the \x18[0xFB]s used as a
        hatchery.
0x00AF: The last \x18[0xFB] has died,
        but the egg you placed in
        the spring will one day
        hatch.Thank you so much…
0x00B0: Mother:\x13\x02!
        \x13\x02:Elina!Where are
        the others?
        Elina:They were killed…
        \x13\x02:Elina,be strong.
        When the war is over,I'll
        come back.

0x00BD: The King of \x18[0xF4]
        declared that any man who
        could enter his castle
        could marry his daughter.
        Many failed attempts were
        made,but a man with a
        bag of hot air landed on
        the roof.
        The \x18[0xED] and the man
        floated away together.
        
0x00BE: Technological advances
        produced the \x18[0xF5].
        Technology could one day
        replace magic.
0x00BF: Long ago,a king asked for
        an indestructible lock and
        key.Three were made.The
        first two were broken in
        two days.The third key
        remained unbroken,so the
        king hid the key in a
        snowy cavern.
        That key was
        the \x18[0xF6].
        
0x00C0: Long ago,a star fell to
        what became Kashuan.A man
        took flame from the star
        and built an altar for it.
0x00C1: The mages knew they were
        too powerful,so they
        founded \x18[0xF8] to remain
        secluded.
0x00C2: Eons ago,Pandaemonium,the
        palace from Hell,emerged
        unto our land.
        
        The mages conjured a
        mighty spell and banished
        it.
        
        The mages feared the great
        power of the spell,so they
        sealed it within a tower.
        
0x00C3: Deist was the home of the
        \x18[0xFB]s.Haan,the first
        \x18[0xFA],spent thirty years
        alongside them.
0x00C4: The \x18[0xFB] was trained to
        fly with \x18[0xFA]s.Though
        smaller than dragons,a
        \x18[0xFB] can carry up to
        five people.
        
0x00C5: Give the White \x18[0xFE] to the
        Goddess underground.

        the doppelganger will
        cease to move.Fit the
        Black \x18[0xFE] upon him,then
        he and his defiled heart
        shall fade.
0x00C6: The \x18[0xFD] leads to
        Pandaemonium,the palace of
        Hell.
0x00C7: Fools!If the \x18[0xEE]
        sees me talking to you,
        I could get killed!
0x00C8: We can goof off more with
        lazy Borghen in charge.
        
        
        Oops!
        Um,you didn't hear that.
        
0x00C9: You're one of us!
        I had to keep my cover
        while the \x18[0xEE] was
        commander.
0x00CA: So you want to destroy
        the \x18[0xF3]…
        I'm on your side.
        
        There's an entrance to
        the sewers up ahead.It
        leads to the \x18[0xF3].

        in the mirror.

        finally hatched!
        
0x00D0: The mirror absorbs the 
        \x18[0x09]'s light.
0x00D1: The \x18[0xF7] blazes
        brightly.
0x00D2: The \x18[0xF7] passes to
        Egil's Torch!

        engine.

        rescue the \x18[0xED] first!

        engine.
0x00D5: The \x18[0xF7] is thrown into
        the \x18[0xF3]'s engine!
0x00D6: It's the Life Spring.
0x00D7: The \x18[0xFB] Egg is gently
        dropped into the spring.
0x00D8: It's the Life Spring.
        The \x18[0xFB] Egg rests at
        the bottom.
0x00D9: It's the Goddess Statue.
0x00DA: The White \x18[0xFE] was placed
        on the statue.
0x00DB: \x10\x02:Out of our way!
0x00DC: The doppelganger is
        motionless.The purity of
        \x10\x02's heart is binding
        its movement!
0x00DD: The Black \x18[0xFE] is placed
        on the doppelganger.
0x00DE: I love Josef,but I know
        that when I'm around I
        just get in his way…
0x00DF: Poor Josef…I'll look
        after Nelly.I know that
        would make him happy.
0x00E0: A mysterious force blocks
        the way.
0x00E1: \x18[0xEE]:Don't just
        stand there!
0x00E2: \x18[0xEE]:You fools
        thought I'd return to
        \x18[0xF4] before the
        \x18[0xF3] was finished?
        Surrender before it's too
        late.Consider my words.

        \x10\x02!You really think
        you can stop me?

0x00E5: \x12\x02:This wall different!
0x00E6: This is the path to Hell.
0x00E7: A secret door!
0x00E8: Slave:Help!
0x00E9: A rock is in the way.
0x00EA: \x13\x02 turns a small rock
        and a passage appears.
        
        
        \x13\x02:The Snowcraft's
        in here.
